It has led\u00a0her to settle in Cabo de Gata in Almer\u00eda, an unusual place where she has found peace surrounded by fossil dunes lashed by the Mediterranean wind.Estefan\u00eda makes each piece entirely by hand, without molds or the use of a potters' wheel, usually applying different textures and then experimental glazes.Measurements:h. 28 cm, w. 12 cmDetails: Handbuilt stoneware vase.

Minimalistic and\u00a0harmonious shapes that celebrate the imperfections and beauty in understated. She expresses herself through the textures and organic nuances of clay, striving towards a balance between traditional techniques and simple elegance. The works are often left unglazed, to show the humble beauty of the material.When working, her aim is to give character to the piece, rather than trying to make it perfect.\u00a0She\u00a0leaves her fingerprints and tool marks as they happen during the creation process. It gives soul to the object and is a trace of\u00a0Laura's process\u00a0from that particular moment.The pieces we are so lucky to present at YONOBI are a\u00a0range of ceramic sculptures that capture the powerful stillness and quiet aesthetic of the moon. These minimalistic shapes, made from stoneware ceramic, celebrate the imperfections, simplicity, and beauty in understated. Being captivated by pure forms that resemble infinity has led the artist to create a series of unique moon jars and circular sculptures. The works reflect influences from traditional Korean ceramics and Japanese principles of wabi-sabi.Dimensions: \u00d8 23 x H 22 cm, opening \u00d8 1 cmMaterial: stoneware ceramicFinishing: glazed matte interior, unglazed natural exteriorColour: blackSignature: artist stamp on the baseShare",

She expresses herself through the textures and organic nuances of clay, striving towards a balance between traditional techniques and simple elegance. The works are often left unglazed, to show the humble beauty of the material.When working, her aim is to give character to the piece, rather than trying to make it perfect.\u00a0She\u00a0leaves her fingerprints and tool marks as they happen during the creation process.

It has led\u00a0her to settle in Cabo de Gata in Almer\u00eda, an unusual place where she has found peace surrounded by fossil dunes lashed by the Mediterranean wind.Estefan\u00eda makes each piece entirely by hand, without molds or the use of a potters wheel, usually applying different textures and then experimental glazes.Measurements:h. 37 cm, w. 24 cmDetails:\u00a0Handbuilt stoneware vase.

The works are often left unglazed, to show the humble beauty of the material.When working, her aim is to give character to the piece, rather than trying to make it perfect.\u00a0She\u00a0leaves her fingerprints and tool marks as they happen during the creation process.

These minimalistic shapes, made from stoneware ceramic, celebrate the imperfections, simplicity, and beauty in understated. Being captivated by pure forms that resemble infinity has led the artist to create a series of unique moon jars and circular sculptures.

The workshop explore the japanesse technique 'Kurinuki'.\u00a0Kurinuki is a Japanese technique and can be translated to \u201cto dig out\u201d. Signe explains about the process:\u00a0\"The process starts with a solid lump of clay, and by cutting small pieces off one by one, I\u2019ll find the shape of my object. When I\u2019ve found the shape I\u2019ll let the lump dry a bit to harden the outside of the shape. That way, I can hold the outside of the form in my palm while removing material from the inside, in order to end up with a container. The process is extremely slow and conscious, and results In unique objects every time.\"Ceramic artist Signe Boisen graduated from the Royal Danish Academy in 2021 and works sculpturally and functionally.\u00a0In creating her objects, she focuses on using her hands as the primary tool.\u00a0When working with clay, she keeps a constant awareness and respect for the material's quality and durability; with that knowledge, she pushes the limits.\u00a0The work often has a repetitive pattern in both the production state and the finished pieces, playing with symmetry and asymmetry.\u00a0Share",
